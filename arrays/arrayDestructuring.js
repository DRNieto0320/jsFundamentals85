/**************************
! ARRAY DESTRUCTURING
**************************
    - allow us to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects
    - similar syntax as array literals BUT is on the LEFT side of the the assignment operator
        - this defines what values to unpack
    - great for puing info out of an array/object and assigning that data to it's own variable
