//! the shift method removes the first element of the array and returns it.
//! this method changes the length of the array

//  Shifting is equivalent to popping, working on the first element instead of the last.
//  The shift() method removes the first array element and "shifts" all other elements to a lower index.

//Example
var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.shift();            // Removes the first element "Banana" from fruits
